{\nolyrics Intro: \[^F] \[^C] \[^E] \[^Am]}
\[F]So long ago, I don't re\[C]member when
That's \[E]when they say I lost my only \[Am]friend\[Am/G]
Well they \[F]said she died easy of a \[C]broken heart disease
As I \[E]listened through the cemetery \[Am]trees\[Am/G]

I seen the \[F]sun comin' up at the \[C]funeral at dawn
The \[E]long broken arm of human \[Am]law\[Am/G]
Now it \[F]always seemed such a waste, she \[C]always had a pretty face
So I \[E]wondered how she hung around this \[Am]place\[Am/G]
\endverse


\beginchorus
{\nolyrics Interlude: \[F] \[E]}
Hey, \[F]come on try a little
\[C]Nothing is forever
\[Dm]There's got to be something \[G]better than
In the middle
\[F]But me and Cinderella
\[C]We put it all together
\[Dm]We can drive it home\[G]
With one head\[F]light
\endchorus

\beginverse
She said it's ^cold
It feels like Inde^pendence Day
And I ^can't break away from this pa^rade^
But there's ^got to be an opening
^Somewhere here in front of me
^Through this maze of ugliness and ^greed^
And I seen the ^sun up ahead at the ^county line bridge
Sayin' ^all there's good and nothingness is ^dead^
We'll ^run until she's out of breath
She ^ran until there's nothin' left
She ^hit the end, it's just her window ^ledge^
\endverse

\textnote {Chorus}

\beginverse
Well this place is ^old
It feels just like a ^beat up truck
I turn the ^engine, but the engine doesn't ^turn^
Well it smells of ^cheap wine, cigarettes
This ^place is always such a mess
Some^times I think I'd like to watch it ^burn^
I'm so ^alone and I feel just like some^body else
Man, I ain't ^changed, but I know I ain't the ^same^
But ^somewhere here in between the ^city walls of dyin' dreams
I ^think of death, it must be killin' ^me^
\endverse
