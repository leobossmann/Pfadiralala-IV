\beginverse
\[Am]Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell 
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high 
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder 
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky 
\[E]The boy could sing, knew how to \[Dm]move, everything 
\[C]Always wanting more, \[G]he'd leave you longing for 
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Dm]Black velvet and that \[G]little boy's smile 
\[Dm]Black velvet with that \[B&]slow southern \[F]style 
\[Dm]A new religion that'll \[G]bring ya to your knees 
\[F]Black vel\[Em]vet if you \[Am]please 
\endchorus

\beginverse
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave 
White lightening, bound to drive you wild 
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl 
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle 
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true 
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for 
\endverse

\textnote{Chorus}

\beginverse*
\[Dm]Every word of every \[E]song that he sang was for \[Am]you 
\[Dm]In a flash he was \[B&]gone, it happened so \[F]soon\[E], 
what could you \[Am]do?
\endverse
